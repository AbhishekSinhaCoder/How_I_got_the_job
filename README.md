`TLDR: Got the offer pre-COVID-19, offer got canceled , then got job offer in a different manner. Learned a lot along the way. Learn from my mistakes and my tricks` 

### Hello, this is my story and here it goes.

**First and foremost clean up your LinkedIn and GitHub (only for computer science && graduate students). Refer to your career services department in your college.**

I started my job searching in October of 2019 as the job market was good at those times and I was too eager to get one. I started bookmarking many top-medium sized IT, software companies career's page. Also join all the recruitment companies present within your locality.(they get paid by getting you a job.) I got all the details from google search. This helped me in reducing the time to go to individual website :arrow_forward: clicking on career section. I even set the filters already in order to reduce the time. 

Also join all the recruitment companies present within your locality.(they get paid by getting you a job.) I got all the details from google search. Do all these at-least 2-3 or even 6 months before the completion of your course.(I should have done this before but later I realized my mistake). 

**Tip 1: indeed, monsters cannot be always trusted because sometimes they would post a job opening which would never be present on company website and vice-versa. So be careful.** 

**Tip 2: indeed, monsters cannot be always trusted because sometime after submitting application on indeed, I would contact recruiter about the update on my application but they would reply "We have not received your application and would advice you to submit directly from our website.". So do that if any suitable opening is available on company's website instead of indeed,monsters.com etc.** 

This helped me in becoming aware of many opening which were niche and not posted on every job websites. Also, this helped me in reaching application to my company and avoiding job portal's brutal **ATS** system.

I got through first stage of interview (which was resume screening) almost 90% of time by tailoring/editing/tuning resume according to the job requirements(priority) and cover letter according to the job specification. 

**Tip 3: Change your resume according to required skills only.For cover letter include some company research and try to answer one important question "How does your skills fit this job profile?"**

The next stage would generally involve coding test or video interview or aptitude test. This was the stage in which I was getting tensed about during initial days.Afterward, I got comfortable by practicing a lot through online means.

**Tip 4: For video interview, try to time your answer within 1-2 minutes(include only key points), always use STAR method for delivering answers. For coding test use hacker rank and leet code. If the test is going to be online, they mostly use codility (which is going to be the standards for the future) so practice on that.**

Afterwards, I would get the information about the next stage which would be one-one interview about your experience, work history(if you have experience).

**Tip 5: Always ask if you could bring any sort of document/presentation with you even if they dont mentioned it. Make a presentation of 6-8 slides about your work experience, final year projects or projects you are comfortable with to explain it to the employees/recruiters of the company. Also read glassdoor profile of company to get an idea about the questions that might be asked in the interview.** 

Now here's what happened to me. I got selected but due to COVID-19 , all my offers were canceled. 

**Now comes the most struggling, boring but important part of my job searching process.** 

Since I got a lot of free-time as I was unemployed during this period(my part -time shifts were also cancelled).I used it in a way that helped me later.

**Tip 6: Contact every recruiters  that offered you a chance for interview and ask for feedback. This will help you later(trust me).I even got praise from few recruiters stating that not many rejected candidates bother asking for feedback.** 

Afterwards, I started improving my soft-skills by recording the questions that I was asked in interviews, and later assessing it. Also, I started learning new skills relevant to my degree.I also took many hacker rank tests and starting posting the results on Linkedin. This caught the eyes of many employees at different companies.

I added them on LinkedIn and requested them to refer me if they or I ever came across any suitable opening in their company. 

In these last few months, some companies started opening vacancies, so I stared my asking employees to refer me on LinkedIn. I was able to get through many rounds but not much far. First I got an unpaid internship in a small company for web developer(which paved path for my future careers).

In the next few months, I started applying to many companies methods through unusual ways. 

**Here is the unusual way:** Since I was a computer science student, I went to contact us page of each small to medium company that could hire a computer science student. I got the email address of every company which were of format info@, career@, etc. Then I drafted a email which was of format "General introduction :arrow_forward: project worked on :arrow_forward: skills :arrow_forward: soft skills :arrow_forward: "I have attached my cv(general) I am looking forward to be hearing from you." :arrow_forward: attach cv."

**Here comes the important part** Never send your cv instantly. Instead schedule your email so that it goes at next day morning 9-10 am.This will ensure that your job email is the first (or among the firsts) thing they see in the morning.

After few weeks I got a call from the company. There was a simple interview regarding my current internship and my past projects. Afterwards, they reviewed my LinkedIn, GitHub and I got the job offer the very next day.
